Dear Nephew,
    I'm writing this e-mail to let you know that my life is in danger. 
Dr. Octopus has got hold of all my inventions, and he is planning something 
insane.
    But, I believe that only you have the abilities to stop him from his cruel 
intentions. I have always created a backdoor in all my works. All those 
backdoors have a password, that is hidden in the file I have attached along
with this email. Only you can open that file. It was always your fate.

   You are our last hope. Don't let us down. 

Your's lovingly,
Uncle Xor
