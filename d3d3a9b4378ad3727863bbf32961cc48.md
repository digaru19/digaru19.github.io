**GENERAL GUIDELINES :-**

- Always follow proper etiquette and ethics when you are contributing to Open-Source projects.
  	- Be polite.
  
- Although very trivial, always, and I mean ALWAYS use proper English language structure.  It matters a lot.
	- Make sure that there are no grammatical mistakes in your communication with them.
	- Always capitalize wherever necessary.
	- Don't use a lot of abbreviations.

- A lot of project maintainers/mentors discourage direct message (DM/PM), unless it's VERY necessary.
	  - If it is a general doubt (regarding the project), always ask in their public discussion channels, like IRC, chat rooms, forums, etc. 
	  - As time passes, and your contributions start being recognised, you may start DM/PM'ing them for suggestions regarding your GSoC proposals and stuffs, but that comes a lot later.


**SHORTLISTING THE ORGANISATIONS :-**

- Make sure that you shortlist only those organisations, which use technologies that you already
  know and are confident about. Don't try to experiment and learn a completely new thing at this 
  point of time. 

- Don't scare yourself away just by looking at the huge source codes of the projects.
  Many of these projects would have been built with a lot of great minds working together,
  over a period of time. You will take time understanding their codebase.
  - Make sure that you atleast get yourself familiar with their project structure pretty early,
    that is, where are their core functionalities, helpers, utilities, tests, etc.
  - If you are not sure of something, ask them.



**WHEN YOU START CONTRIBUTING :-**

- Claim an issue on the bug tracker before working on it. 

	- Follow proper guidelines for git commit messages. 
	  - There are a lot of resources available for this.
	  - Here's a short one :- https://github.com/trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices

- Start using Git properly. It is a very huge plus point. Most of the organisations are very
  particular about it. 
	  - Know when to rebase, reset, stash, cherry-pick, checkout, fetch, pull, and merge. 
	  - Make sure your commit history looks neat. 

- If their is a discussion going on (like on their Issues, Pull request, etc) and if you feel that you can add value to their discussions concerning the project, make sure you get yourself involved in that discussion. It shows that you are interested, and that you know your stuff properly.
	  - If you are doing it, make sure that you are doing it genuinely. Know your shit well.
	  - Don't just poke your nose around in their discussions, just to get yourself noticed. If you do this, it's a very huge turn-off, and lowers your credibility. 

- Some organisations have their own style and guidelines for contributing. Stick to it.
	  - Comment your code wherever necessary.
	  - Many follow particular code standards. For example, PEP8 for Python.
	  - Some would ask you to squash all your commits into 1-2 commits, as they don't like populating their main branch with trivial commits.

- Document your work VERY well. When you are done with the coding part (which is pretty interesting and easy), now comes the hard part. 
 	 - While submitting your changes, say through a pull request, or sending a patch, document your
    changes very well. Specify the issue which is being fixed by it, or explain your changes if it is a new feature.
	  - Sometimes, you might end up writing a 20-lines explanation for a one-line change in the source,
    but still do it :) 
 	 - But be very concise in it. Remember KISS - "Keep it simple, stupid" .
	  - _Example :-_ Assume there is some issue, which says that using a particular text input crashes the program.
               Now, you claim the issue and start working on it, and figure out that it is happening
               due to an improper encoding of unicode characters. You fix the issue locally.
               Now, when you are submitting your changes, write about the cause of the issue (improper unicode character conversion, in this case), and how you fixed it. 
               If there were multiple ways of fixing it, mention those too, and also mention why you did it the way you did it. This increases your credibility. 


**PRAY :-** :pray: :pray: :pray:
- Everyday, in the morning, you should wake up at sharp 6 o' clock :clock6: , and pray to the Open Source God _Sri Ranganathan_ :raised_hands: . Having his photo in your pocket or wallet will also help. His blessings will boost your chances.
